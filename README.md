hotelproject
============

This is my Hackbright Academy Final Project. I'll be Demoing on Career Day on April 8th.

My MVP is single city hotel search that includes point information as well as cash costs.  I travel (a lot!) and haven't been able to find an easy way of determining the point cost of hotel options across chains in a single city without going to the individual chains websites manually.  My MVP solves that, and makes travel planning for me (and all the other travel hackers out there with points across chains) a little bit easier.  I'll also provide CPP information so you can figure out how much value you're getting per point simply and easily.  At launch, the brands I'm planning on supporting are Starwood, Hilton, Marriot, and Hyatt.  Tier 2 additions will most likely be IHG and Club Carlson.

Version 1.1 will include a "Loyalty is expensive option" that includes alogorithmically curated non-major brand hotels that provide high value/satisfation (determined via TripAdvisor ratings) at low cost.  Whenever I go to Paris, I generally stay at a non major brand hotel unlesss I have major points to burn just because the options are so damn pricey.  Even though I'm a pretty loyal hotel traveller, there are times when it's not worth paying for a room at one of the chains.

Version 2 will focus on handling and optimizing multi-city hotel search. Basically, I want the site to answer the following question: if I'm going to Amsterdamn, Cologne, Berlin and Paris, where do I spend my Starwood Points, where do I spent my Hyatt points, and where do I just spend cash?  The application will ideally provide you with a few viable answers to the question, so if you want to spend as little cash as possible, get the highest CPP possible, or do something in between, you'll be able to.

Questions, comments, and suggestions are all welcome! I'm most comfortable coding in Python, but expect a solid amount of JS in here.
